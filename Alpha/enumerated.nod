type enumerated  -- intrinsic
{{
	enumerated is a base type for countable subtypes.

	An enumerated object is associated with a unique and
	identical integer value.  The value must be greater
	than or equal to zero, and it must uniquely identify
	one, and only one object in a set of objects of the
	same enumerated type.

	Best practice is to assign ints contiguously from zero.

	The Nod compiler fabricates and derives app enum types
	from enumerated.

	alpha types ascii and unicode are enumerated subtypes.

	Technically, enumerated is a complete type, but there's
	no point in instantiating an object	with an actual type
	of enumerated.
