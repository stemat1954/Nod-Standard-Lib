type analog  -- intrinsic,restricted
{{
	An analog is an objectified proxy.

	An analog can only be created by the compiler using
	an analog expression (proxy ref enclosed in square 
	brackets). 
	
	Proxy analogs are always transient and anonymous. An
	analog captures the proxy's state at the point of 
	creation and it may change.

	There are no :begin methods.  The HNM initializes an
	analog when it's created.
